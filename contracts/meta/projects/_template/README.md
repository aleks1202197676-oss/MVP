# Project docs template

Use this folder as a reusable scaffold for any independent project. Copy the entire folder, rename it to your project id, then fill all placeholders.

## Required files

- `PROJECT_MAP.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `TRACKS.md`
- `CHECKS.md`
- `METRICS.md`
- `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`
- `DECISION_LOG.md`
- `LLM_RESPONSE_PROTOCOL.md`

## Isolation rule

All project-specific decisions, checks, metrics, and status updates must stay inside the project folder. Only `contracts/meta/PROJECTS_INDEX.md` may reference multiple projects.
