# DECISION_LOG: finance_mvp

| date | decision | options considered | rationale summary | impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-15 | Use per-project documentation folders with a single root index | Keep one monolithic meta doc; split by project folders | Project isolation reduces context mixing during LLM handoff | Clearer ownership, safer parallel tracks |
| 2026-02-15 | Keep overlap guard as planned/next until fully enforced | Mark complete early; keep explicit partial status | Honest status avoids false completion signals | Better governance transparency |
